## Preparations

This is a hands-on workshop, which has been adapted to suit a webinar.
These are difficult times for us all, and attending (let alone participating) in a webinar is quite a lot.
And still, I encourage all of you to follow these steps so you will come prepared and be able to try the commands yourself while following along.

1. Create a GitHub user:

   - Navigate to [GitHub](https://github.com/join)
   - Create a user
   - Add you username to [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1R_E1-9csNvyTKy9Y5QXo4OAEp45XcPxFzDwfp6zedtk/edit?usp=sharing) google-sheet

2. Install Git

   - Navigate [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads), for windows it might be better [here](https://gitforwindows.org/)
   - install - make sure you install git bash as well as git itself, the rest of the options aren't crucial

3. Configure your user in Git Bash
   - Open Git Bash, should be added when installing git.
   - configure your default user - run the command `git config --global user.name "<YOUR_NAME>"`
   - cache your password - run the command `git config --global credential.helper wincred`
   - If you are adventurous try configuring an SSH key (easier login) - follow the tutorial [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)
